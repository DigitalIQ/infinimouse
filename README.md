If you move mouse to one border, it'll come from the other.

Works for multiple screens too, but will have issues if the screen
layout doesn't make a perfect rectangle (e.g. for different
resolutions).


## Settings

Settings are hardcoded in the script. By default, only left and right
borders are used. You can also adjust the main loop delay.
